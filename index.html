      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a social scientist and educator bridging classroom experience with academic research to drive meaningful policy change. My background in political and data science includes published research on Ohio's voting behavior, and my recent experience teaching 8th-grade science through Teach For America deepened my commitment to educational equity. This fall, Iâ€™ll begin an MA in Social Science at the University of Chicago, with a focus on social policy, violence prevention, and psychoanalytic theory. Long-term, I aim to pursue doctoral study in social policy.
